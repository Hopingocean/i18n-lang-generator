# Generate translation json files for [vue-i18n](https://github.com/kazupon/vue-i18n)

This is a forked project of [webpack-i18n-generate-json](https://github.com/gkShine/i18n-generate-json). This was made to cater to our own workflow where we want to support vue-i18n's Locale messages syntax. Right now it will only work with nested objects like $('message.hello') and not $('message[0]')
